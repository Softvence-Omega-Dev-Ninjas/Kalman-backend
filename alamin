Hi Simon,
I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to follow up regarding the hosting and domain — have you had a chance to arrange them yet?

Also, we noticed that you shared the Hostinger login details, but we’re unable to access the account without the verification code.  please join a short meeting with us so we can get access to the hosting account and complete the setup smoothly.

Please let us know if you need any help or guidance with this — we’ll be happy to assist.

Best regards,
